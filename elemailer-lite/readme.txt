== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to use Elemailer lite's template =

Elemailer Lite creates form templates under wp-admin > Elemailer > Forms. With each form, it has a shortcode that can be used with supported plugins ( list above ). 

For Elementor Pro you simply need to create our form template > Go to the elementor page where you have the Elementor pro's form widget > When you add the after submit action ( Email & Email2 ) you will see the option to select our template at the bottom of each Email & Email2. 

= Can I create more than 3 templates with the lite version? =

With Elemailer Lite, you can only create 3 email templates for your forms. If you require more, you can purchase one of the paid plans.

= Why the style options are so limited? =

Email platforms are not yet as smart as our general website browsers, for which reason they don't support much modern CSS and no JS at all. This is why the style options are limited. 

The pro version does offer more options and also gives you system to use your own styling/custom CSS/ HTML if you want depending on your use case, for example, your targeted users might be using Gmail only, which has a higher rate of CSS support compared to other email applications. The paid version also offers you font style and font change method( for safe-to-use fonts only ). 

= Do you support SMTP / Have SMTP system / Provide sending service? =

Our plugin is for designing your Emails. We don't handle the Email sending part and let you / your site do it for you as this gives you freedom to choose which SMTP plugin/system you will use, which email sending service such as sendgrid, sendplus, mailgun, AWS you will use. As long as these systems are configured for your WordPress site(s) and the basic email sending works for your site, our system will simply work with it without any issue. This is why we have no limtation regarding number of emails or whatso ever when it comes to sending in the Pro version too. 

= What is the AI Email builder? =

Elemailer allows you to create content for your widgets ( text ) and images with the help of AI, which is powered by Elementor's amazing AI.

= Do I need to pay to use the AI email builder? =

The Email AI system that is used in Elemailer is the [Elementor's AI API](https://elementor.com/products/ai/). It's free for use and the amount of prompts is more than enough for basic uses. The limit is not well mentioned but [this](https://elementor.com/terms/elementor-ai-terms-and-conditions/) can give you some idea. According to our test the limit is probably around 7,000 Words. But if you need more for some reason or want to use it in your website design too, they offer additional credit purchase on demand for a relatively low price per month. 

How the Credit's are counted mostly: 
1 Text prompt = 1 credit
1 Code prompt = 1 credit
1 Image prompt = 33 credits

Keep in mind when generating text, code or images, you may want to use multiple prompts until you reach your desired result.

= Can I remove the footer Branding and add my own? =

Elemailer Lite comes with a footer branding by default. If you get the Elemailer paid version, the footer branding will not be there at all. But besides this, we have also thought of our users & kept a setting under Elemailer to remove the branding for free if you really want to. 
You may go to wp-admin > Elemailer > Setting > Select Remove footer branding > Hit save. But we would appreciate spreading this amazing plugin to the community by keeping the Branding in the footer or in any other way as you see fit. Posting on some WordPress groups also sounds good :) if this plugin really helped you.
